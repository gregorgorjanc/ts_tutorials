# tutorials

A set of tutorials for the tskit ecosystem build using
[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/), served up at
[https://tskit.dev/tutorials/](https://tskit.dev/tutorials/)


**Under construction**

These are quick notes for developers while the real developers page is
under construction.

# Requirements

Install the Python requirements from requirements.txt:
```
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt ```

You will also need a working R installation with reticulate and irkernel installed.
This command should do the trick:
```
$ R -e 'install.packages(c("reticulate", "IRkernel")); IRkernel::installspec()'
```

# Building tutorials

- To add a new tutorial, create a Markdown file and add its name to ``_toc.yml``.
- If you are basing the tutorial on an existing notebook, use
  [jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) to convert the notebook into
  the right format.
- To build locally, run ``make``. The output tells you where to find the
  built HTML.
- Pages rendered at https://tskit-dev.github.io/tutorials/
- Pages might take a while to be updated after a new tutorial is merged.

If you have an idea for a tutorial, please open an issue to discuss.
